## Download As HTML

This will download the landing page as .html file. If your landing page is named: My Free Offer, the page will be my-free-offer.html

Then you can host this file on your FTP, and link to it. 

*** Note:** you are not downloading the landing page source, you are downloading a router page. We do this so any change you make, will appear without you changing anything...

Watch the video above to see how to upload this your FTP program...
